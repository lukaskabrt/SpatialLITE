# SpatialLITE

SpatialLITE is a lightweight .NET library for spatial data processing.

![CI](https://github.com/lukaskabrt/SpatialLITE/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=develop)


## Features
* Reads / writes data in variety of formats
    * WKT (Well-known text)
    * WKB (Well-known binary)
    * GPX
    * OpenStreetMap XML
    * OpenStreetMap PBF
* Analytics functions
    * Distance / area calculations
    * Basic topology analysis


## Getting started

Install the NuGet package:
``` ps
Install-Package SpatialLite.Core
```

Use library:
``` c#
var geometry = WktReader.Parse<LineString>("linestring (-10.1 15.5, 20.2 -25.5, 30.3 35.5)");

Console.WriteLine("Start point: {0}", geometry.Start);
Console.WriteLine("End point: {0}", geometry.End);

// Writes:
// Start point: [-10.1; 15.5; NaN, NaN]
// End point: [30.3; 35.5; NaN, NaN]
```

## Packages

SpatialLITE is distributed as a set of NuGet packages. You can install only packages, you need.
